This is a simple Python script that filters a list of email subjects and prints those containing the word **"lead"** (case-insensitive). It’s useful for prioritizing potential business or sales leads from a general inbox.

 2.##  How It Works :

- Loops through each email subject.
- Converts the subject to lowercase.
- Checks if the word `"lead"` is present.
- Prints only the subjects that match.
